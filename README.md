# AI/ML Job Market & Skill Gap Analytics Using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores job market trends related to Data Analytics, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning using SQL.

The goal is to analyze job postings, salaries, required skills, experience levels, work modes, and locations to understand which technical skills employers require.

**Note:** This project uses a synthetic dataset for learning and portfolio demonstration. It does not represent verified live job market statistics.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze job postings and salary information.
- Identify frequently required technical skills.
- Compare the demand for SQL, Python, AI, and Machine Learning skills.
- Explore job opportunities by location and work mode.
- Compare entry-level and experienced job roles.
- Examine combinations of skills required for different roles.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- MySQL
- SQL
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub

## 🗂️ Database Tables

The project contains six tables:

1. `companies` — company information.
2. `locations` — job locations.
3. `skills` — technical and professional skills.
4. `jobs` — job roles, salaries, and experience details.
5. `job_skills` — relationship between jobs and required skills.
6. `job_postings` — job posting details and related information.

The `jobs` table contains 100 sample job records.

## 📊 Key Analysis Areas

- Most in-demand technical skills
- Salary analysis by job role
- SQL versus Python skill demand
- AI and Machine Learning job trends
- Entry-level versus experienced positions
- Remote, hybrid, and onsite opportunities
- Location-wise job opportunities
- Skill combinations associated with job roles
- Relationship between skills, experience, and salary

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Install and open MySQL Workbench.
2. Open `01_database_setup.sql`.
3. Execute the script to create and populate the database.
4. Open `02_analysis_queries.sql`.
5. Select and execute the analysis queries.
6. Review the results in MySQL Workbench.

**Important:** Run the setup script carefully because it may recreate the database and replace existing project tables.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

- Practiced SQL database creation and data management.
- Worked with relational tables and joins.
- Practiced filtering, aggregation, grouping, and sorting.
- Explored analytical questions related to job-market data.
- Organized SQL work into a GitHub portfolio project.
